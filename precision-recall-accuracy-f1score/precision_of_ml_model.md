# What is Precision Of An ML Model

## Introduction

In machine learning, evaluating the accuracy of a model's predictions is critical to ensuring its effectiveness. Performance metrics like precision provide a way to measure the accuracy of a model's positive predictions, which can help identify areas for improvement and optimize the model for specific use cases.

## Definition

Precision is a performance metric used in machine learning models to measure the accuracy of positive predictions. It represents the proportion of true positive predictions out of all the positive predictions made by the model.

## Calculation

To calculate precision, divide the number of true positive predictions by the sum of true positive and false positive predictions:

**Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)**

For example, consider a machine learning model that identifies whether an email is spam or not. After testing the model on a dataset of 100 emails, we get the following results:

- True positives: 20 emails are correctly identified as spam.
- False positives: 5 emails are incorrectly identified as spam.
- False negatives: 15 emails that are actually spam are not identified as such.
- True negatives: 60 emails are correctly identified as not spam.

Using the formula above, we can calculate the precision of the model as:

**Precision = 20 / (20 + 5)**

**Precision = 0.8 or 80%**

This means that out of all the emails predicted to be spam by the model, 80% were actually spam. A high precision value indicates that the model is making few false positive predictions, meaning that when the model predicts an email to be spam, it is likely to be correct. Conversely, a low precision value indicates that the model is making a large number of false positive predictions, meaning that when the model predicts an email to be spam, it is more likely to be incorrect.

## Conclusion

Precision is a critical metric in scenarios where false positive predictions have serious consequences. For example, in medical diagnosis, a false positive diagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatment or harm to the patient. However, precision should not be used in isolation to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. Other metrics like recall, accuracy, and F1 score should also be used to get a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. The choice of metrics depends on the specific problem being solved and the nature of the data.
