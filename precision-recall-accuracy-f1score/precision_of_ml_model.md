# What is Precision Of An ML Model

Precision is a performance metric used in machine learning models to measure the accuracy of the model's positive predictions. In other words, precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all the positive predictions made by the model.

In other words, precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all the positive predictions made by the model. It can be expressed mathematically as:

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

Let's look at an example:

Suppose a machine learning model is trained to identify whether an email is spam or not. After testing the model on a dataset of 100 emails, it makes the following predictions:

True positives: 20 emails are correctly identified as spam.

False positives: 5 emails are incorrectly identified as spam.

False negatives: 15 emails that are actually spam are not identified as such.

True negatives: 60 emails are correctly identified as not spam.

To calculate precision, we take the number of true positives (20) and divide it by the sum of true positives and false positives (20 + 5):

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
Precision = 20 / (20 + 5)
Precision = 0.8 or 80%

This means that out of all the emails predicted to be spam by the model, 80% were actually spam. A high precision value indicates that the model is making few false positive predictions, meaning that when the model predicts an email to be spam, it is likely to be correct.

A high precision value indicates that the model is making few false positive predictions, meaning that when the model predicts a sample to be positive, it is likely to be correct. Conversely, a low precision value indicates that the model is making a large number of false positive predictions, meaning that when the model predicts a sample to be positive, it is more likely to be incorrect.

The precision metric is especially important in scenarios where false positive predictions are costly or have serious consequences. For example, in medical diagnosis, a false positive diagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatment or even harm to the patient. In such cases, a high precision model is preferred even if it means sacrificing some of the recall (true positive rate).

It is important to note that precision should not be used in isolation to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It should be used in conjunction with other metrics such as recall, accuracy, F1 score, and others to get a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. Additionally, the choice of metrics depends on the specific problem being solved and the nature of the data.
