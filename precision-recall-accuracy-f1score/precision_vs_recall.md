# Difference between Precision & Recall

Recall and precision are two metrics used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in binary classification problems. Although they both measure the model's ability to make correct predictions, they capture different aspects of the model's performance.

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the proportion of actual positive samples in the dataset that are correctly identified by the model as positive. Mathematically, it is defined as:

Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

A high recall value indicates that the model is correctly identifying a large proportion of the positive samples in the dataset. A low recall value, on the other hand, means that the model is missing a significant number of positive samples.

Precision, on the other hand, is the proportion of positive predictions made by the model that are actually true positive samples. Mathematically, it is defined as:

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

A high precision value indicates that the model is making a relatively small number of incorrect positive predictions. A low precision value, on the other hand, means that the model is making a large number of incorrect positive predictions.

In general, recall and precision are trade-offs, meaning that increasing one typically comes at the expense of the other. This trade-off is often depicted using the precision-recall curve, which shows how the model's precision and recall values change as the decision threshold is varied.

In applications where it is important to identify as many positive samples as possible, such as medical diagnosis or fraud detection, recall is typically given more weight. In contrast, in applications where precision is more important, such as email spam classification, precision is typically emphasized.

Recall and precision are two commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. In a binary classification problem, there are two classes, commonly referred to as positive and negative. The goal of the model is to correctly classify instances as positive or negative.

Recall measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all positive instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. In other words, recall is the proportion of actual positive instances that the model correctly identifies.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances out of all instances that it has classified as positive. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. In other words, precision is the proportion of instances that the model classified as positive that are actually positive.

To understand the difference between recall and precision, consider a scenario where a model is trained to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. In this case, a positive instance represents a fraudulent transaction and a negative instance represents a legitimate transaction.

If the model has high recall, it means that it is able to correctly identify most of the fraudulent transactions, which is important for detecting all instances of fraud. However, a high recall may also result in a higher number of false positives, which means that the model may classify some legitimate transactions as fraudulent.

If the model has high precision, it means that it is able to correctly identify a high proportion of the transactions it has classified as fraudulent, which is important for reducing the number of false positives. However, a high precision may also result in a lower recall, which means that the model may miss some fraudulent transactions.

In summary, recall and precision are both important metrics for evaluating the performance of a binary classification model, but they capture different aspects of the model's performance. A model with high recall is able to correctly identify most of the positive instances, while a model with high precision is able to correctly identify a high proportion of the instances it has classified as positive. The optimal balance between recall and precision depends on the specific application and the associated costs of false positives and false negatives.

Overall, both recall and precision are important metrics for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model, and the choice of metric(s) depends on the specific problem being solved and the relative importance of different types of errors.
